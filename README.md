# retrobbs

Set of tools to implement a BBS on a suffieciently unixy box.

A good chunk of this system was written a couple years ago using a different resposity. Some of the data was damaged there, and I am working on fixing it and getting it on github. I had intended on migrating to github earlier as the date on this stuff shows but I had a some problems in making that happen.
